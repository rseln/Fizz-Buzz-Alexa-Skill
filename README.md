# Alexa Skill: Fizz Buzz

Fizz buzz is a group word game. Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz". Words divisible by three and five are replaced with "fizz buzz". To play with Alexa, the invocation of "fizz buzz" is used. Alexa starts with 1 and the user takes turns listing the next numbers/values. Since Alexa is unbeatable, the user's high score is recorded to keep track of the maximum rounds played.
